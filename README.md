This is a mock admin dashboard for a pretend website. The goal of this project was to create the visual design, and so nothing is clickable.

Among the skills demonstrated are :

 - flexbox
 - grid
 - custom properties
 - embedded SVGs


The page was not designed for different screen sizes, and so only looks good at certain sizes.
If I revisit this, making the page look nice at all widths will be something I work on.
